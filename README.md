# Etch-a-Sketch

## This project belongs to The Odin Project course curriculum.
 
 Using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, I made a paint-similar website where you can draw on a square white grid by hovering over it. 
 
 You can also customize the amount of squares per side as per your liking.

 That's pretty much it, the project is simply just for JavaScript training purposes.
